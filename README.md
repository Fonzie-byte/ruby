# Ruby scripts

Here you'll find mostly stand-alone scripts, either the results of me trying out new things, building tools for myself, or simply toying around with the Ruby language.

One I am more proud of is my [Markov Trigram-based string generator](/strings/generators/markov_trigram_text_generator/README.md).
